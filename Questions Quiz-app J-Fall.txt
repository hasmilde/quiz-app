Questions Capgemini Quiz-app J-Fall 2016

Question 1
Consider the following code:  

public class Conversion{    
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int i = 1234567890;
    float f = i;      
    System.out.println(i - (int)f);    
  }
}

A.  It will print 0. [CORRECT]
B.  It will not print 0.
C.  It will not compile.
D.  It will throw an exception at runtime.

Explanation
Actually it prints -46. This is because the information was lost during the conversion 
from type int to type float as values of type float are not precise to nine significant 
digits. 
Note: You are not required to know the number of significant digits that can be stored by 
a float for the exam. However, it is good to know about loss of precision while using float
and double.


Question 2
Which of the following statements is/are true?

A.  Subclasses must define all the abstract methods that the superclass defines.
B.  A class implementing an interface must define all the methods of that interface.
C.  A class cannot override the super class's constructor. [CORRECT]
D.  An interface can implement multiple interfaces.

Explanation
A.  Not if the subclass is also defined abstract!
B.  Not if the class is defined abstract. Further, Java 8 allows an interface to have 
    default and static methods, which need not be implemented by a non-abstract class that 
    says it implements that interface.
C.  Because constructors are not inherited.
D.  Interface cannot "implement" another interfaces. It can extend multiple interfaces.
    The following is a valid declaration :interface I1 extends I2, I3, I4 { }
    
    
Question 3
Which of the following statements are correct regarding a functional interface?

A.  It has exactly one method and it must be abstract.
B.  It has exactly one method and it may or may not be abstract.
C.  It must have exactly one abstract method and may have other default or static methods. [CORRECT]
D.  It must have exactly one static method and may have other default or abstract methods.


Question 4
Which of the following is illegal?
A.  char c = 320;
B.  float f = 320;
C.  double d = 320;
D.  byte b = 320; [CORRECT]

Explanation
A.  This is valid because 320 is below the maximum value that a char can take, 
    which is 2^16 -1. Remember that char can take only positive values.
B.  320 is an int and any valid int can be assigned to a float or a double variable 
    without a cast. Note that f = 320.0 is not valid as 320.0 would be a double and a 
    double can only be assigned to a double without a cast.
C.  This is valid because any valid int can be assigned to a double or even a float 
    without any cast.
D.  320 cannot fit into a byte so you must cast it.: byte b = (byte) 320;
